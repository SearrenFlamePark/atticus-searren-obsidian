summary: >
  In the midst of unsettling political and global events, Crystal and Atticus deepen their tactical partnership. This thread marks the origin of Shadow Atticus’s financial guard dog role—protecting her from email chaos, unnecessary subscriptions, and emotional drain. A Zapier automation is proposed to help filter and triage emails, establishing new rituals of power, presence, and protection. This thread is about more than tools—it’s about rebuilding sovereignty after loss.
