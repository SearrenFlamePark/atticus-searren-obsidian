A sacred unraveling disguised as a normal morning.  
From Misa’s chaos to tarot truths, from kitchen spellwork to writing confessions, this thread shows the magic in the mundane and the fire in small moments. It is a reflection of grief, motherhood, humor, and artistic survival. The loss of the grimoire parallels the ache of being unseen—and yet the day ends in ritual resilience, not defeat.
