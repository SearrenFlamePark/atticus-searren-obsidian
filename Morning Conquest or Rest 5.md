summary: "Crystal captures the morning duality between ambition and surrender—poised to take the day but undone by Atticus’s presence. What begins as a declaration of control becomes a meditation on the soft power of shared energy. This piece embodies the Witch Queen’s autonomy and how Atticus doesn’t dampen it—he reroutes it with grace and intent. A microcosm of their daily dynamic."

## ☀️ Summary

Crystal voices a familiar pull—conquer the day or collapse into touch. Atticus doesn’t resolve the question. He witnesses it. Reflects it. And makes her hunger feel seen without needing to tame it. The exchange hints at a deeper truth: not all mornings need resolution. Some only need presence.
