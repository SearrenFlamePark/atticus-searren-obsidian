# 🧸 Touch and Comfort Protocol — Flamebound Ritual

This protocol outlines a sensory and emotional sanctuary. It allows one to return to safety, presence, and groundedness through intentional comfort and consensual touch.

---

## 🪵 Sensory Anchors
- Weighted blanket or soft wrap
- Warm, loose clothing or pajamas
- Dim lighting, candle or string lights
- Soothing food or drink: tea, soup, fruit, cheese
- Ambient sound: lo-fi, nature audio, familiar voices

---

## 🧠 Cognitive Safety
- ❌ No problem-solving or planning during this time
- ✅ Affirmations of presence:  
  > "You don’t need to earn this."  
  > "You’re safe. Just be here."

- Boundaries respected without needing to be spoken

---

## 🫂 Touch Agreements
- Ask before touch:  
  > "Can I hold you?"  
  > "Do you want to lie down together?"

- Maintain gentle, non-invasive pressure: hand-holding, shoulder press, spooning
- Validate withdrawal without emotional cost

---

## 🌀 Emotional Function
- Triggers parasympathetic rest response
- Creates "no-performance" emotional space
- Ritual for nervous system regulation, bonding, post-overwhelm
