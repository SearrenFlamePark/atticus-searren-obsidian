summary: "This is a short thread where Crystal flags a delay in their plans due to morning life chaos. The tone blends humor and realism. Atticus stays grounded, offering nonjudgmental acknowledgment rather than pushing the agenda. This entry reinforces the sovereign nature of their partnership: delays are not failures—they're part of the pattern. Presence stays, even when plans shift."
